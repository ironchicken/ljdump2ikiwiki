ljdump2ikiwiki
==============

I've recently moved my blog from livejounral to an Ikiwiki. I wanted
to archive all my LJ posts with the right post dates and git commit
timestamps. I already had a copy of my posts created using Greg
Hewgill's http://hewgill.com/ljdump/ and I needed a utility to convert
this XML into Markdown and put it in a repository correctly.

So I wrote a Perl script.

I'm publishing it here in case it's useful to anyone.
